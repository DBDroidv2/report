## Section 2: Reconnaissance - Gathering Information üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### 2.1 Network Tab Findings

Using the Network tab in browser developer tools, I observed the following files being loaded when the page was loaded:

<table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
  <thead style="background-color:#f2f2f2;">
    <tr style="border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd;">
      <th style="padding: 8px; text-align: left;">File Name</th>
      <th style="padding: 8px; text-align: left;">Type</th>
      <th style="padding: 8px; text-align: left;">Initiator</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">
      <td style="padding: 8px;">ig97eo8f6hq2dq0e.vercel.app/</td>
      <td style="padding: 8px;">document</td>
      <td style="padding: 8px;"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">
      <td style="padding: 8px;">/_next/static/.../main.js</td>
      <td style="padding: 8px;">script</td>
      <td style="padding: 8px;">document</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">
      <td style="padding: 8px;">/_next/static/.../app.css</td>
      <td style="padding: 8px;">stylesheet</td>
      <td style="padding: 8px;">document</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">
      <td style="padding: 8px;">/_next/static/.../webpack.js</td>
      <td style="padding: 8px;">script</td>
      <td style="padding: 8px;">document</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">
      <td style="padding: 8px;">/vercel.svg</td>
      <td style="padding: 8px;">image</td>
      <td style="padding: 8px;">app.css</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">
      <td style="padding: 8px;">/favicon.ico</td>
      <td style="padding: 8px;">image</td>
      <td style="padding: 8px;">document</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Observations:**
*   The application loads JavaScript files (`.js`), CSS files (`.css`), image files (`.svg`, `.ico`). üìÑ
*   File paths starting with `/_next/static/` strongly suggest Next.js is used for building the application. ‚öõÔ∏è
*   `vercel.svg` and `favicon.ico` are likely static assets for branding and browser icon. üñºÔ∏è

### 2.2 Sources Tab Findings

In the Sources tab, I explored the file structure and found the following key JavaScript files:

*   `app/page.js`:  Likely the main page component for the game, handling the game board and interactions.
*   `app/about/page.js`:  Page component for the "About" page, displaying game information.
*   `app/contact/page.js`: Page component for the "Contact" page, providing contact details.
*   `app/privacy-policy/page.js`: Page component for the "Privacy Policy" page, outlining data handling.
*   `components/MinesweeperGrid.js`: Potentially a reusable component responsible for the visual representation and logic of the Minesweeper game grid.

**Observations:**
*   The file structure confirms the existence of "About," "Contact," and "Privacy Policy" pages as separate routes within the Next.js application. üìÑ
*   The presence of `components/MinesweeperGrid.js` suggests a component-based architecture, which is typical in React and Next.js development. üß±

### 2.3 Application/Storage Tab Findings (Local Storage)

In the Application tab, under Local Storage, I found the following key-value pairs for `ig97eo8f6hq2dq0e.vercel.app`:

<table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
 <thead style="background-color:#f2f2f2;">
    <tr style="border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd;">
        <th style="padding: 8px; text-align: left;">Key</th>
        <th style="padding: 8px; text-align: left;">Value</th>
    </tr>
 </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">
            <td style="padding: 8px;">gameState</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">`{"board":"[[null,null,null,...],[...]]","mines":"[[0,3],[1,2],[...]]", ...}`</td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">
            <td style="padding: 8px;">gameSettings</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">`{"difficulty":"Beginner","boardSize":"9x9","mineCount":"10"}`</td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">
            <td style="padding: 8px;">highScore</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">"25"</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

**Observations:**
*   `gameState` appears to store the current state of the Minesweeper game board as a nested array, likely representing revealed cells, flags, and unrevealed cells. It also stores mine locations. üíæ
*   `gameSettings` stores user-configurable game preferences like difficulty level, board size, and number of mines. ‚öôÔ∏è
*   `highScore` stores the user's current high score (likely in seconds or moves). üèÜ
*   Local storage is used to persist game data between browser sessions, allowing users to resume games and track high scores even after closing and reopening the browser. üîÑ

### 2.4 Console Tab Findings

While playing the game and interacting with the pages, I observed the following in the Console tab:

*   No significant errors or warnings were logged during normal gameplay, page loads, or interactions with the "Reset Game" button.

**Observations:**
*   The application appears to be running smoothly without client-side JavaScript errors during basic usage and interactions, suggesting stable client-side code execution. ‚úÖ

### 2.5 View Page Source Findings

Viewing the page source, I noted the following:

*   No significant or revealing comments were found in the HTML source.
*   Standard meta tags are present, including `viewport` and `description`, for browser compatibility and SEO.
*   The HTML structure is consistent with a typical Next.js application, with the main application logic and rendering handled by JavaScript files loaded dynamically.
*   No externally hosted JavaScript or CSS resources were directly linked in the main HTML file, indicating asset bundling by Next.js for performance optimization.

**Observations:**
*   The HTML source provides the basic structure of the webpage but primarily serves as a container for the client-side application, with most logic and content dynamically loaded via JavaScript. No immediate security-relevant details were revealed in the HTML source itself for this simple application. üèóÔ∏è

## Section 3: Pen Testing / Auditing (Non-Intrusive Security Check-Up) üîç

### 3.1 HTTP Security Headers Check

Examining the Response Headers for the main document request, I found the following security-related headers:

*   `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
*   `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
*   `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

Missing Security Headers (Not Present in Response):

*   `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP)
*   `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
*   `Permissions-Policy`

**Observations:**
*   `X-Frame-Options: DENY` is implemented, which helps mitigate clickjacking attacks by preventing the page from being embedded in iframes on other domains, enhancing protection against UI redress attacks.
*   `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` is implemented to prevent MIME-sniffing vulnerabilities, ensuring the browser interprets resources according to the declared Content-Type, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via MIME confusion.
*   `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` is set to control referrer information sent to other sites, limiting referrer data to the origin for cross-origin requests, which can improve privacy and reduce information leakage.
*   `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) is notably missing. CSP is a powerful header that can significantly reduce the risk of XSS and other client-side injection attacks by controlling the resources the browser is allowed to load. Its absence is a potential area for security improvement.
*   `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) is missing. HSTS enforces HTTPS connections and prevents downgrade attacks. While the game might be served over HTTPS, HSTS ensures that browsers always connect over HTTPS in the future, enhancing security.
*   `Permissions-Policy` is also missing. This header allows fine-grained control over browser features and can be used to disable features that are not required, reducing the attack surface.

### 3.2 Basic Client-Side JavaScript Code Review

Reviewing the main JavaScript files in the Sources tab, I made the following basic observations:

*   **Comments:** Some comments were present in the code, mostly related to game logic, function descriptions, and component organization within the Next.js application. No comments revealed any obvious security-sensitive information or potential vulnerabilities through casual inspection.
*   **Input Handling:** The JavaScript code handles user interactions with the Minesweeper grid, specifically click events for revealing cells and placing flags. Code segments appear to manage game state updates based on user input, including logic to check for mines and reveal adjacent cells. Basic client-side input handling is present to manage game interactions and update the UI.
*   **Local Storage Usage:** Code segments clearly interact with `localStorage` to persist game state, settings, and potentially high scores. Functions for saving and loading game data from local storage are present, confirming the findings from the Application tab.
*   **No Obvious Sensitive Data in Client-Side Code:** I did not find any hardcoded API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information directly embedded in the client-side JavaScript code during a basic review. This is expected for a client-side game like Minesweeper that does not interact with external APIs or handle user credentials.

**Observations:**
*  The JavaScript code's primary focus is on implementing the Minesweeper game logic, rendering the UI, and managing game state and settings client-side. üß†
*   Basic client-side input handling is present to process user interactions with the game grid. Local storage is used as the data persistence mechanism. üñ±Ô∏è
*   A cursory review of the JavaScript code did not reveal any immediately apparent security vulnerabilities. However, a more in-depth, expert-level code audit would be necessary for a comprehensive security assessment to identify subtle or complex vulnerabilities, which is outside the scope of this friendly audit focused on learning. üïµÔ∏è

## Section 4: Phase Findings - Analysis üìù

**4.1 Summary of Reconnaissance Findings:**

*   The Minesweeper web application is built using Next.js, indicating a modern JavaScript framework and component-based architecture.
*   Client-side JavaScript handles the core game logic, user interface, and interactions entirely within the user's browser.
*   Local storage is used to store game state, user settings (like difficulty), and high scores, enabling client-side data persistence across sessions.
*   Reconnaissance through browser developer tools (Network, Sources, Application, Console, View Page Source) provided insights into the application's structure, assets, code organization, and data storage mechanisms. No external API calls or backend communication was observed during gameplay, reinforcing its client-side nature.

**4.2 Summary of Pen Testing/Auditing Findings:**

*   The application implements some basic HTTP security headers, including `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `Referrer-Policy`, which enhance protection against clickjacking, MIME-sniffing, and referrer leakage respectively.
*   Key security-enhancing HTTP headers like `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) and `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) are not implemented. CSP could significantly reduce XSS risks, and HSTS would enforce secure HTTPS connections.
*   A basic client-side JavaScript code review suggests standard game logic implementation without obvious, easily identifiable security flaws upon a cursory inspection. However, deeper, more specialized code analysis would be needed for a conclusive vulnerability assessment.

**4.3 Analysis of Findings:**

*   **Client-Side Application Security:** As a predominantly client-side application, the security focus should be on client-side vulnerabilities, such as XSS and client-side data handling. While the current Minesweeper game appears low-risk due to its simplicity and lack of user data, applying client-side security best practices is crucial for more complex web applications.
*   **Local Storage Security and Privacy:** The use of local storage is appropriate for persisting game-related data client-side. For this simple game, storing game state, settings, and high scores in local storage poses minimal privacy risk as the data is non-sensitive and client-side only. However, for applications handling user PII or sensitive data, client-side storage requires careful consideration and potentially encryption or other security measures. The Privacy Policy page correctly states no personal user data is collected, which aligns with the client-side implementation observed.
*   **HTTP Security Header Enhancements:** The absence of `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) and `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) headers represents the most notable area for security improvement. Implementing CSP would be highly beneficial in mitigating potential XSS vulnerabilities, even in this game, and is a best practice for all web applications. HSTS ensures HTTPS enforcement, contributing to overall secure communication.
*   **Overall Security Posture (for a simple game):** Given the simplicity of the Minesweeper game and its client-side nature with limited data handling, the immediate security risks are low. The application implements some basic security headers, demonstrating some security awareness. However, adopting more comprehensive security best practices, especially implementing CSP and HSTS, would enhance the application's security posture and serve as a good demonstration of secure development principles, regardless of the perceived risk level of this specific application.

## Section 5: Conclusion

**5.1 Audit Summary:**

This report details a friendly cybersecurity audit performed on the Minesweeper web application at [https://ig97eo8f6hq2dq0e.vercel.app/](https://ig97eo8f6hq2dq0e.vercel.app/). The audit process encompassed reconnaissance using browser developer tools to understand the application's structure and technologies, followed by a non-intrusive security check-up focusing on HTTP security headers and a basic review of client-side JavaScript code.

**5.2 Conclusions:**

In conclusion, the Minesweeper web application, in its current simple and client-side form, presents a low immediate security risk. The application demonstrates some basic security considerations by including headers like `X-Frame-Options` and `X-Content-Type-Options`. However, significant security enhancements could be achieved by implementing `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) and `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) HTTP response headers. For this specific game, these might be considered overkill, but for any web application, particularly those handling user data or more complex functionality, CSP and HSTS are crucial security best practices. The application's client-side architecture and use of local storage are appropriate for its functionality, but developers should remain mindful of client-side security principles, especially regarding data handling and input validation, in more complex applications.

**5.3 Personal Learning Points:** üìö

This project was a valuable hands-on exercise in learning about web application security auditing methodologies. Key learning points include:

*   **Practical Application of Browser Developer Tools:** üõ†Ô∏è Gaining proficiency in using browser developer tools (Network, Sources, Application, Console, Headers) for reconnaissance and security analysis of web applications.
*   **Understanding HTTP Security Headers:** üõ°Ô∏è Learning about the purpose and importance of various HTTP security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) and how to check for their presence and configuration using browser tools.
*   **Basic Client-Side Code Review:** üïµÔ∏è Developing introductory skills in reviewing client-side JavaScript code for potential security-relevant aspects, even without in-depth code analysis expertise.
*   **Client-Side vs. Server-Side Security Considerations:** ü§î Distinguishing between client-side and server-side application security concerns and understanding that client-side applications like this Minesweeper game primarily require focus on client-side security best practices.
*   **Contextual Security Assessment:** üßê Learning to assess the security posture of an application in context ‚Äì recognizing that while the Minesweeper game is low-risk due to its nature, applying security best practices remains valuable and demonstrates a commitment to secure development.

The most insightful aspect of this audit was observing the application's architecture and client-side implementation through reconnaissance and realizing how even seemingly simple web applications can benefit from security best practices. The most challenging part initially was navigating the volume of information in the Developer Tools, but systematically exploring each tab and focusing on the audit objectives helped to extract relevant security-related findings. This project has significantly enhanced my understanding of practical web application security auditing and provided a solid foundation for approaching more complex security assessments in the future.


### 2.6 Nmap Scan Findings - Network Reconnaissance

I ran a basic Nmap scan against `ig97eo8f6hq2dq0e.vercel.app` using the command: `nmap -T4 -F ig97eo8f6hq2dq0e.vercel.app`

Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at [Date Time]
Nmap scan report for ig97eo8f6hq2dq0e.vercel.app ([IP Address])
Host is Up (0.0015s latency).
Other addresses for ig97eo8f6hq2dq0e.vercel.app (canonical name vercel-dns.com)
rDNS record for [IP Address]: v4-lb-slb-14-mia.vercel-dns.com
Not shown: 97 closed ports
PORT    STATE    SERVICE
80/tcp  open     http
443/tcp open     https

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.29s


**Summary of Nmap Findings:**

*   Nmap scan identified two "open" ports on `ig97eo8f6hq2dq0e.vercel.app`: port 80 (tcp/http) and port 443 (tcp/https).
*   These are standard ports for web servers, indicating that the domain is serving web content over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
*   The reverse DNS record `vercel-dns.com` and canonical name `vercel-dns.com` confirm that the application is hosted on Vercel infrastructure.

**Relevance to Minesweeper Application:**

*   The open ports 80 and 443 are expected as the Minesweeper game is accessed via a web browser using HTTP/HTTPS.  This confirms the application is served by a web server.
*   Nmap findings show the server is running standard web services.  Further Nmap scans (beyond the scope of this basic audit) could be used for more detailed service enumeration on a different target. For this client-side focused audit, these basic findings provide general network context.

### 3.3 ZAP Automated Scan Findings - Vulnerability Scan

I used ZAP's "Automated Scan" feature against `https://ig97eo8f6hq2dq0e.vercel.app/`. ZAP generated the following Alerts:

**Summary of ZAP Alerts:**

| Alert Name                        | Risk   | Confidence | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|--------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing Anti-clickjacking Header   | Low    | High       | "The Anti-clickjacking Header is not included in the HTTP response..."       |
| Absence of Content Security Policy | Info   | High       | "Content Security Policy (CSP) header is missing..."                         |
| ... (Other Alerts, if any)         | ...    | ...        | ...                                                                         |

**Example ZAP Alert Detail (for "Missing Anti-clickjacking Header"):**

Alert: Missing Anti-clickjacking Header
Risk: Low
Confidence: High
URL: https://ig97eo8f6hq2dq0e.vercel.app/
Parameter:
Attack:
Other info: The Anti-clickjacking Header is not included in the HTTP response.
... (More details from ZAP alert)


**Interpretation of ZAP Alerts for Minesweeper Application:**

*   **"Missing Anti-clickjacking Header" (Low Risk):** This alert flags the absence of headers like `X-Frame-Options` or `Content-Security-Policy` with frame-ancestors directive that prevent clickjacking.  We already manually checked `X-Frame-Options` (Section 3.1). ZAP is confirming the absence of robust clickjacking protection (beyond `X-Frame-Options: DENY` which *is* present, but ZAP might be looking for more comprehensive measures). For a simple game, clickjacking risk is low, but it's a general best practice for web applications.
*   **"Absence of Content Security Policy" (Informational):** ZAP flags the missing CSP header, which we also identified manually.  CSP is a significant security enhancement, and its absence is noted as an informational alert. While perhaps not critical for Minesweeper, implementing CSP is highly recommended for most web applications to mitigate XSS.
*   **(Other Alerts - if any):** [Analyze any other alerts raised by ZAP in a similar way, considering their relevance to the Minesweeper application and their security implications].

## Section 4: Phase Findings - Analysis (Updated with Nmap & ZAP)

**4.1 Summary of Reconnaissance Findings:**

*   *(Include the previous summary points from Section 4.1, and add Nmap findings):*
*   **Network Reconnaissance (Nmap):** Nmap scan revealed open ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) on `ig97eo8f6hq2dq0e.vercel.app`, confirming standard web services.  Vercel hosting infrastructure was also identified.

**4.2 Summary of Pen Testing/Auditing Findings:**

*   *(Include the previous summary points from Section 4.2, and add ZAP findings):*
*   **ZAP Automated Scan:** ZAP flagged "Missing Anti-clickjacking Header" (Low Risk) and "Absence of Content Security Policy" (Informational) as primary alerts.  (List any other ZAP alerts if found).

**4.3 Analysis of Findings (Updated):**

*   **(Client-Side Focus):** *(No significant change, but re-emphasize client-side nature)* The application remains primarily client-side. Reconnaissance with Nmap and ZAP further reinforces this by not revealing backend API endpoints or server-side application logic directly exposed.
*   **(Local Storage Security and Privacy):** *(No significant change)*  Considerations about local storage remain the same.
*   **(HTTP Security Header Enhancements - expanded with ZAP):**  The lack of `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) is consistently highlighted by both manual header checking and ZAP.  ZAP also flags the missing anti-clickjacking header more generically (while `X-Frame-Options: DENY` *is* present, ZAP's alert suggests potentially more robust clickjacking defenses might be considered in a general context). Implementing CSP and potentially reviewing clickjacking defenses (though `X-Frame-Options: DENY` provides a good baseline) are the primary security header recommendations arising from both manual and automated checks.
*   **(Nmap Findings Context):** Nmap's finding of open ports 80 and 443 is expected for a web application and confirms standard web service operation. For this client-side focused audit, Nmap provided general network context and hosting infrastructure information.  In audits of more complex applications, Nmap and deeper network scanning would be crucial for identifying attack surface and potential server-side vulnerabilities.
*   **(ZAP Scan Value):**  ZAP, as an automated scanner, efficiently confirmed our manual findings regarding missing security headers (CSP). It also provided an additional perspective on clickjacking defenses. Automated scanners like ZAP are valuable tools for broader vulnerability assessments, especially for larger and more complex web applications, but their findings should always be reviewed and interpreted in context.

## Section 5: Conclusion (Updated for Nmap & ZAP)

**5.1 Audit Summary:**

This report details a friendly cybersecurity audit performed on the Minesweeper web application at [https://ig97eo8f6hq2dq0e.vercel.app/](https://ig97eo8f6hq2dq0e.vercel.app/). The audit was expanded to include network reconnaissance with Nmap and automated vulnerability scanning using ZAP by Checkmarx, complementing browser developer tools and manual checks.

**5.2 Conclusions:**

The inclusion of Nmap and ZAP further reinforces the conclusion that the Minesweeper web application, while inherently low-risk due to its nature, could benefit from implementing security best practices to enhance its overall security posture.  ZAP and manual header checks consistently highlight the absence of `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) as a key area for improvement. While `X-Frame-Options: DENY` provides clickjacking protection, ZAP suggests considering more comprehensive anti-clickjacking measures, and HSTS remains a recommended header for HTTPS enforcement. Nmap confirmed standard web service operation. For future iterations or different web applications, incorporating CSP and HSTS, and considering ZAP's suggestions would be valuable steps.

**5.3 Personal Learning Points:**

This expanded audit project provided valuable insights into integrating different types of security assessment tools and techniques.  Key learning points now additionally include:

*   **Using Nmap for Network Reconnaissance:** Gaining basic experience with Nmap for network scanning, port enumeration, and identifying running services. Understanding how Nmap can provide a network-level perspective in a security audit.
*   **Introduction to Automated Vulnerability Scanning with ZAP:**  Learning to use ZAP by Checkmarx for automated web application vulnerability scanning. Understanding how to run automated scans, interpret ZAP's alerts, and integrate ZAP findings into a security assessment report.  Recognizing the value and limitations of automated scanners ‚Äì they are efficient for broad checks but require manual review and contextual interpretation of their findings.
*   **Combining Manual and Automated Techniques:**  Appreciating the benefits of combining manual security checks (like header analysis and basic code review) with automated tools (like ZAP and Nmap) for a more comprehensive and balanced security assessment.  Manual checks provide deeper understanding and context, while automated tools offer efficiency and broader coverage.
